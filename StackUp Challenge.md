---------------------------   Challenge Statement i choose   ---------------------------
* Ideate a solution that can elevate the StackUp platform experience
Write about an idea that can improve the StackUp platform experience, whether its a reworking of our apps, or a completely new app/activity on the platform
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

*-> The issue I'm about to rise in StackUp platform is "My Progress" tab section where most of the stackies faced issue and suggested to change the UI(user interface) of that which is kind of reworking of the StackUp My Progress tab.

ISSUE: Reworking the "My Progress" Tab for Better User Experience

* Firstly, In the "My Progress" tab of the dashboard, users can track their quest activities, including those that are submitted, reviewed, under review, and their outcomes (approved, rejected, and rewarded). While the interface is designed to be user-friendly, users often face challenges when trying to view quests that are currently under review or have specific statuses. 

-- Secondly, The currently issue is, The interface shows a series of small component cards summarizing key information like submission due, submitted quests, rewarded quests, and total money earned. The main problem arises when users attempt to locate quests that are under review. Below these cards, users can see sections for ongoing quests (submitted) and past quests (reviewed). However, the quests under review are not immediately visible, requiring users to scroll extensively.

-- Furthermore, Just imagine that this issue becomes particularly cumbersome for users with a large number of quests. Imagine a user who has completed over 100 quests; scrolling down to find which ones are under review can be frustrating and time-consuming. This difficulty extends to finding quests that have been approved, rejected, or rewarded, as they are mixed with other quests in a lengthy list.

-- In conclusion, The Proposed Solution is that:
1. Additional Cards/Components: Introduce dedicated cards or components that specifically highlight quests under review. This would allow users to quickly identify these quests without the need to scroll excessively.

2. Layout Redesign: Redesign the layout of the "My Progress" tab to clearly segregate different types of quests. 

3. Filtering and Sorting Options: Implement filtering and sorting options within each section. This will allow users to sort quests by date, status, or reward amount, providing a more customizable and user-friendly experience.

Benefits:
Implementing these changes will offer a more streamlined and intuitive experience on the "My Progress" tab. Users will be able to quickly locate quests under review, see status updates, and view outcomes without endless scrolling. This will reduce frustration and enhance overall satisfaction with the platform.

Conclusion:
Addressing the current challenges with the "My Progress" tab by adding specific cards for under-review quests and redesigning the layout will significantly improve usability. These enhancements will provide users with a clearer, more organized view of their quest progress, contributing to a better overall experience on the StackUp platform.

By making these adjustments, we can ensure users can effortlessly navigate their quest activities, leading to increased engagement and satisfaction.
